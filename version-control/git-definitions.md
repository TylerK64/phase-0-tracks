# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control is a method that allows programmers the ability to view the entire history of edits made to a certain program(s) and also merge these edits made by multiple people. It is useful because often programs will be edited by multiple people simultaneously so this allows us to concurrently work on a project. Additionally, having previous versions of a program is beneficial in case something goes awry. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch is an independent fork of a project in which a separate feature is to be merged back to the (master) file(s). Branches are generally useful so the master file is left intact, so in case something unplanned comes about only the new data will be affected. Also branches allow multiple features to be added to a project by multiple users simultaneously. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit is when a new file(s) is "officially" added back into a git repository (after being staged first). A good commit message describes a detailed message of all the changes made to the project since the previous commit. 

* What is a merge conflict?
  A merge conflict occurs when there is an divergence/inconsistency between the current branch and the branch you wish to merge. This occurs when there are commits in current branch that are not in the other branch and vice versa, or if the same line of a certain file has been edited differently by multiple people.
