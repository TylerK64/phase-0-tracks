<!-- Release 4: Reflect
1. The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to define an element with a specific purpose which is used as a certain section of an HTML page. The ones I see as most useful are: <section>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, and <figure>.

2. The order in which elements are displayed are as follows: inline CSS overrules CSS rules in style tag, which overrides the CSS file; more specific selectors take precedence over less specific ones; rules that appear later in code overrule earlier rules when the specificity is the same. 

3. Sublime seems like a very useful tool, mainly for the snippet function (so far). Having a shortcut for writing certain lines of code will likely be a helpful feature in the future probably for loops or other repetitive, basic code.

4.Researching the details behind the snippet code and how to implement its syntax was probably the most challenging part of this assignment. In the future, learning concepts like this one can be managed by exposing myself to more foreign code and trying to recognize similar patterns when I'm faced with something new.
