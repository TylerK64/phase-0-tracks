Web stack refers to the collection of software required for Web development. This includes at least an operating system, a programming language, database software, and a Web server. The basic order is generally something like OS -> database -> web server -> server side code -> browser -> client side code. Although ultimately the web stack is not a true stack and simply a term used to neatly catergorize the web development process.

For example: LAMP - Linux (OS), Apache (Web server), MySQL (DB), PHP (scripting language) - is a commonly used web development platform as it is all open source.
