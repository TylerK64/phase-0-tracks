There are five main classes of HTTP response status codes which are: informational responses, successful responses, redirects, client errors, and server errors. These five classes are catergorized from 1xx to 5xx, with each class corresponding to a set of 100 codes. 

1xx - These codes are usually used for HTTP 1.1 as an informational response to the client. It tells the client that that request has been recieved and understood and to wait for a final response. 

2xx - These are status codes to indicate the action by the client was recieved, understood, accepted, and processed successfully. 
200 is likely the most common response code as it indicates that the request was successful. 

3xx - These status codes indicate the client must take additional action to complete the request, and are usually used for URL redirection.

4xx - These codes are used to indicate the client has erred. 

5xx - These codes are used to indicate the server has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.
