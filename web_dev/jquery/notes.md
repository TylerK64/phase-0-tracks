Release 0: Make a Plan

-Timeboxing: Time approx 50 mins chunks for researching and figuring out basic JQuery syntax and other similar libraries if necessary
-Find cheat sheets, faqs, good basic examples, etc
-Search for sites to compare/contrast the differences between JS and JQuery
-Try to figure out relationship between the two and how to perform similar functions, methods, etc
-If extra time: Try and find similar libraries, apps, etc to apply jquery knowledge
-Maybe take a five to ten min break every hour or so

-Be sure to apply examples and code to practice HTML website, use github.io website from earlier weeks
-While researching, make note of specific websites that seemingly make use of good JS/Jquery formatting, possibly try and emulate similar solutions if possible
-Possibly try and find some basic HTML/CSS templates online if necessary to practice more advanced/in-depth JQuery topics



Release 1: Study Up (Review)
I think the most effective part of my research session was just trying to find overview topics of jQuery and how to grasp a 'big picture' view of the topic. While cheat sheets were somewhat helpful, I wouldn't say they were particularly useful for a first time approach to the subject matter since it's hard to put them into practice. 

Also, taking notes during the session seemed useful (see jquery practice/jquery_notes.md) and noting new topics, further areas to research, or general tips. Finding the right search terms to google was key to this exercise, so going forward hopefully I'll manage to filter my results better based on this experience. Finally, looking at the API docs was a very useful resource and I'm sure I'll look into those more soon.

Only other thing worth noting is that I wish I spent a bit more time looking more indepth into more involved topics, such as the event menthod.
