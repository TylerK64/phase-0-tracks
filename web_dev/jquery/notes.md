Release 0: Make a Plan

-Timeboxing: Time approx 50 mins chunks for researching and figuring out basic JQuery syntax and other similar libraries if necessary
-Find cheat sheets, faqs, good basic examples, etc
-Search for sites to compare/contrast the differences between JS and JQuery
-Try to figure out relationship between the two and how to perform similar functions, methods, etc
-If extra time: Try and find similar libraries, apps, etc to apply jquery knowledge
-Maybe take a five to ten min break every hour or so

-Be sure to apply examples and code to practice HTML website, use github.io website from earlier weeks
-While researching, make note of specific websites that seemingly make use of good JS/Jquery formatting, possibly try and emulate similar solutions if possible
-Possibly try and find some basic HTML/CSS templates online if necessary to practice more advanced/in-depth JQuery topics
