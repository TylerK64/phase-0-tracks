    <ol>
      <li><b>Tempo</b> - The speed at which the the passage of music should be played. Often measured as beats per minute (BPM). Practice by keeping in time with your metronome to a specific BPM.</li>
      <li><b>Rudiments</b> - Knowledge of drumming rudiments is critical for one's success. There are many different types that are commonly displayed in music. You can find more information at the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_rudiment">link</a>.</li>
      <li><b>Traditional and Matched Grip</b> - With traditional grip, the right stick is held straight forward like a wand while the left hand is held between the index and ring finger, like a fork. Matched grip is when each hand holds one stick straight forward, palms down like a wand.</li>
      <li><b>Reading Music</b> - In order to play prearranged pieces, one must first be able to translate sheet music into its proper meaning.</li>
      <li><b>Types of Drums and Percussion</b> - Knowing the different types of drums is crucial for any developing drummer. Drum kits typically include: a snare drum, bass drum, hi hat, a few toms, and a couple of cymbals. There are also many types of percussion instruments that can help maintain the groove of any song.</li>

This website uses headers a bit better than mine, their page has better organization overall. The social media share buttons are a nice touch as well. The example page uses <section> and <div> elements well for easy to read formatting. Also their use of headers and footers is useful for navigating through their website. -->
